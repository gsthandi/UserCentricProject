# User Centric Development Project

### The Monkees Website

This project is a static website for the band “The Monkees” and provides information about the band and provides a way of interacting with the band via social media links. The project is a platform in which fans and potential fans can get direct access to the band’s music, images and videos.

The technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome.

The project was tested on different browsers to ensure the project functioned in the same manner. Google Dev Tools was utilised to ensure the project was responsive and operational on different devices with varying screen sizes.

Some code such as the home-section took inspiration from the ‘bootstrap-lesson’ workspace created in Cloud9. The CSS code was used to create a landing-style homepage; I changed the ‘min-height’ value and replaced it with a value with the rem measurement and also removed the ‘display:flex’ value as I wanted the display to be block. I also used the ‘opaque-overlay’ class and values from the ‘Bootstrap-lesson’ for my home-section as it was required for making the home-section text more easier to read.

NOTE: I was unable to download the audio files from the relevant github repository and so there is no audio sub-directory attached, although I have written the HTML code as if the audio files were present.
